## About

This is a simple Finance Logger created with Typescript by following [The Net Ninja's TypeScript Tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZmKW9-I_k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI&index=1). This is the first time I've ever coded in TypeScript, and admittedly, it's not as bad as it's been made out to be. I'm beginning to understand it's advantages with strict typing and added features, such as interfaces and tuples. However, I can't help but think it makes code more verbose.

## Lessons Learned

The key takeaway I have from this tutorial is that TypeScript allows you to use strict types. In other words, you can explicitly specify what type of data variables should be. This in turn makes it easier to spot and fix bugs in the code. It reminds me of when I learned a bit of Java in college, which was also a bit more verbose for my liking.
